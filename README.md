## Background

Many studies of the current COVID-19 pandemic point to the significant role played by superspreading
events (SSEs) in the explosive growth and sustained transmission of the disease.


An SSE has occurred when an individual infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected many other
people gathered in the same venue. The basic reproduction number (R) of SARS-CoV-2 is between 2 and 3.
That means on average, if no action is taken to prevent spreading, an infected person will pass on the virus
to 2 or 3 others. There is wide variation, however, and in SSEs the virus is passed to many more than 3
others. In fact, most infections are transmitted by a small number of people. Typical data show that around
10% of cases account for 80% of secondary infections.


SSEs are often the result of individuals spending time close to one or more infected persons in crowded,
indoor, poorly ventilated spaces such as restaurants, gyms and fitness clubs, dance clubs, singing practices,
etc. In early examples from Hong Kong, outbreaks followed: (i) two linked SSEs in which several
individuals who were infected at a social event subsequently attended a wedding (marked W, below) where
one or more of them infected several others; (ii) an SSE involving attendees at a temple (marked T, below).
